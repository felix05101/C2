> **Excalibur C2** is a lightweight and powerful Command and Control system (C2) built with FastAPI, SQLite, and a sleek HTML/JS frontend. It enables command execution on registered clients, tracks victim metadata, and supports PowerShell tasking.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Victim registration with system metadata
- ‚úÖ Periodic heartbeat and status update
- ‚úÖ Remote PowerShell command execution
- ‚úÖ Command history & execution tracking
- ‚úÖ Saved command management (create, edit, delete)
- ‚úÖ Modern macOS-inspired web dashboard
- ‚úÖ SQLite-based persistent backend
- ‚úÖ CORS-ready, API-first architecture

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Web Interface

The frontend is written in pure HTML/CSS/JS with a minimalistic UI.

### Highlights:
- üìä Victim Table with metadata and command options
- üíæ Saved Commands modal with easy CRUD
- ‚ö° Quick command execution (custom or saved)
- üîî Toast notifications & confirmation modals

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. Victim Agent (`agent.py`)
- Collects hostname, IP, OS info
- Registers with the C2 server via `POST /api/victims/status`
- Polls for pending commands from `/api/victims/{id}/commands`
- Executes them using PowerShell
- Sends back output via `/api/victims/{id}/report`
- Marks command as executed

### 2. Backend (`main.py` + `controllers.py`)
- FastAPI with REST endpoints for:
  - Victim management
  - Command queuing & execution
  - Saved command templates
- Uses SQLite with SQLAlchemy models
- Mounted frontend at `/` using `StaticFiles`

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy pydantic`

### 1. Launch Server
```bash
python main.py
# or
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Access the panel at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

### 2. Start Agent on Client
```bash
python agent.py
```

Ensure the `SERVER` address in `agent.py` points to the C2 host.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Notes

- Frontend uses no frameworks ‚Äî just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- You can enhance the DB using `alembic` if needed
- Agent supports only Windows PowerShell execution (can be extended)
- Modify `excalibur.db` schema via SQLAlchemy models

---

## üìå To-Do
- [ ] Authentication system (JWT or session)
- [ ] Encrypted agent-server communication (HTTPS)
- [ ] Agent obfuscation / stealth mode
- [ ] REST API documentation (Swagger UI)
